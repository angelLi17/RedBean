# RedBean
Video call platform for studying and productivity!

### How to use :))
App Store Link: WIP, TBD

### How I made this

### What I learned
Improved at SwiftUI a lot! Learned MVVM model to control my app workflow, learned a lot about how to make the Views adaptable using VStacks, HStacks, and ZStacks. Worked with Firebase Auth <- need to figure a lot out still tho ðŸ˜¿. How to use third party calling APIs and Apple Contacts. Overall super rewarding experience, although I spent way too long on this for no reason. Also spent a lot of time on Figma working on UI/UX, and can always improve on that though - as a graphic designer I've been designing based on appearance and not functionality like a ui/ux-er should, but I think it worked out fine.

### Future Improvements
Future expansions are listed below. This is an open source project, so if you have any suggestions or want to try completing any of the tasks below, feel free to make a pull request. Key: No emoji = not working on, Star emoji = claimed and working on, Green check mark = done.
- contacts - add your own number
- more login functionality (google, reset password, forgot password)
- profile customizability (rename user, add pfp)
- more photobooth options
- users can save a custom schedule they worked through to use as one of their default options
- shredder
- adapt the beginning screens to any dimension phones instead of hardcoding pixels :skull:
