# RedBean
Two-person video calling platform for studying and productivity! Built-in schedules, timers, and checklists while calling, with photobooth feature as an incentive.

Why I made this project? I tried to think of an idea that would give me an introduction to app development but was also relatively challenging for me and novel, it also addresses my own lack of motivation to study 😹 I find studying with my friends so much more motivating and productive and wanted to create a consolidated platform that incorporates my method of studying (pomodoro/timer system) and virtually calling my friends.

### How to use :))
🚧 App Store Link: WIP, TBD 🚧

### How I made this
Blood sweat and tears 😁 and struggling and figuring things out. Shoutout to the internet for being my syntax buddy that helped me grasp SwiftUI syntax WHILE building 🔨💻. UI/UX in Figma, all digital art + drawing credits to [\@happyartth1ngs](https://www.instagram.com/happyartth1ngs/), put it together in XCode with SwiftUI, aided briefly by Cursor (free credits ran out 😿😿).

### What I learned
Improved at SwiftUI a lot🫀! Learned MVVM architecture to control my app workflow, learned a lot about how to make the Views adaptable using VStacks, HStacks, and ZStacks. Worked with Firebase Auth <- need to figure a lot out still tho 😿. How to use third party calling APIs and Apple Contacts. Overall super rewarding experience, although I spent way too long on this for no reason. Also spent a lot of time on Figma working on UI/UX, and can always improve on that though - as a graphic designer I've been designing based on appearance and not functionality like a ui/ux-er should, but I think it worked out fine. Hey, I learned more markdown tools to make this readme too.

I struggled with everything lol even in the beginning with creating the different views. Something super insignificant that actually took me hours was figuring out how to share variables like userID among the million files I had created in an attempt to follow the mvvm architecture... yeah maybe I should have done a crash course in Swift before but that actually confused me so badly. Like what is the difference between ObservableObject, State, Bindable, Binding, etc and WHY ❓. 

### Future Improvements
Future expansions are listed below. This is an open source project, so if you have any suggestions or want to try completing any of the tasks below, feel free to make a pull request (edit the README in ur pull request as well). 
Key: No emoji = not working on, ⭐ Star emoji = claimed and working on, ✔️ check mark = done.
- contacts - add your own number
- more login functionality (google, reset password, forgot password)
- profile customizability (rename user, add pfp)
- more photobooth options
- users can save a custom schedule they worked through to use as one of their default options
- shredder
- adapt the beginning screens to any dimension phones instead of hardcoding pixels :skull:
- connect photobooth to Instagram story
